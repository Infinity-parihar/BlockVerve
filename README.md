# BlockVerve

## Project Description
BlockVerve is a blockchain-based smart contract project built on Ethereum using Solidity. It enables the creation and management of virtual events in a decentralized manner, allowing users to organize events, register attendees, and retrieve event details securely on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
To empower decentralized event management, fostering transparency, immutability, and accessibility for global communities without relying on centralized platforms. BlockVerve aims to make event coordination seamless in the Web3 era, reducing fraud and enhancing trust through smart contracts.

## Key Features
- **Event Creation**: Users can create new events with a name and future date.
- **Attendee Registration**: Participants can register for existing events, incrementing the attendee count.
- **Event Details Retrieval**: Query any event's name, date, and current attendee count.

## Future Scope
- Integrate ERC20 token payments for event entry fees or donations.
- Add voting mechanisms for event agendas or polls using on-chain governance.
- Implement access controls (e.g., owner-only event editing) and event cancellation features.
- Expand to include NFT ticketing for exclusive events.
- Deploy on testnets like Sepolia and integrate with front-end dApps for user-friendly interfaces.
